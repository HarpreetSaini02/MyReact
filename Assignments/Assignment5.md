CHAPTER 5

Q1. What is the difference between Named Export, Default export, and * as Export?
Default Export:
In default export we write like this on the last line of component file ðŸ‘‡

export default Header
Use it when you have only one component in a file

Default Import: We can change the name of import as well

  import Header from ./components/Header
or

  import NewHeader from ./components/Header
Usage: <Header /> or <NewHeader />

Named Export:
When we write like this ðŸ‘‡. This is called named export

  export const Header = () => {...}
Recommended method when we have more than one component in a file.

Named Import:

  import { Header } from ./componentsHeader
Usage: <Header />

* as Export:
If there are more than component in a single file and we have done named export there then we can import them like this ðŸ‘‡. obj is any object name

  import * as obj from ./components/Header
Usage: <obj.Header>, <obj.Title>

Q2. What is the impirtance of config.js file?

It is good practice to create a config.js/constant.js file in src folder.
When we need same thing in many places, we can create a constant for that value and can use it anywhere. So we need to change it, we can change it from one place only. Example ðŸ‘‡
constant.js -> export const IMAGE_CDN_URL = "xyz.com/img.jpg"
Other files -> import { IMAGE_CDN_URL } from "./constants"

Q3. What are React Hooks?

React Hooks are just normal function of javascript, already created by fb devs to perform a specific functionality. eg. useState() is a hook

  import { useState } from react;

Q4. Why do we need useState Hook?
To create a state variable
It returns a array [variableName, function to update the variable]

e.g.
  [myVariable, setMyVariable] = useState()

  Ques1. Difference between named export, default export and * as export?
Ans. Named Export: When we have to export multiple values from a file then we can do named export where each export will have a name and can be used with the same name in different files. For importing named export we have to use below syntax:

import { xyz } from '.xyz'
Default export: When we have to export single value from a file we can do default export. Same name will be used for importing.

import xyz from '.xyz'
star as export(* as export): This is also similar to named export but here we can rename the imported data.

import * as abc from '.xyz'
now we can use abc.xyz instead of xyz

Ques2. What is the importance of config.js or constant.js file?
Ans. By introducing such files we achieve modularity and clean code. In such files, we can have our data from a separate file keeping the component clean.

Ques3. What are React hooks?
Ans. React Hooks are simple JavaScript functions that we can use to isolate the reusable part from a functional component. Hooks can be stateful and can manage side-effects. React provides a bunch of standard in-built hooks: e.g.,

Ques4. Why do we use useState hook?
Ans. useState is a Hook that lets you add React state to function components, similar to class component. It is used to manage states and returns a stateful value and an updater function to update it.
